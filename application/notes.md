# FST components for Python

(C) 2017 D. Cavar <dcavar@iu.edu>

Note DC:
I changed the code of foma.py such that it works with Python 3.x. This is not the same as in the foma-repository
on GitHub. If you want to use any tool that makes use of Foma, you should copy the *foma.py* lib to the folder
where your Python distro finds it for import. In my case, I use Anaconda, it is the folder:

anaconda/lib/python3.5/


## Installation
